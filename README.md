# 2D Hidden Object Game
 
## Adding a New Object
- In order to add a new hidden object to the scene, open the Assets/Prefabs folder and drag the HiddenObject prefab into the scene.  
- You can edit this object's sprite, name and collider to your liking.  
- Open the HiddenObjectManager Object and add an element to the Hidden Objects list.  
- Put your new object in this list.

## Object Attributes
- Objects will be displayed in text on the left hand side of the screen in the order that they are put in the HiddenObjectManager list.
- Their name will be determined by the name of the object in Unity.
- When objects are clicked on in game, they will be removed from the list and the scene.
